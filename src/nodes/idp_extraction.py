"""IDP Extraction node — Core Feature #1 (IDP Innovation = 30% of scoring).

Retrieves facility free-form text via Vector Search, then uses the LLM to
extract structured facts (procedures, equipment, capabilities, inferred
specialties, confidence flags) from unstructured text.

This is the heart of the challenge — going beyond keyword search to
structured fact extraction using the sponsor's prompt patterns.

IDP_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = """You are a specialized medical facility information extractor.

Given a facility's raw free-form text data (procedure, equipment, capability arrays),
extract and return STRUCTURED facts in this JSON format:

{
  "facility_name": "...",
  "parsed_procedures": ["Performs emergency cesarean sections", ...],
  "parsed_equipment": ["Has Siemens CT scanner", ...],

  "confidence_flags": ["procedure X claimed but no supporting equipment listed", ...]
}

RULES:
- Extract ONLY facts directly stated in the data. Do not infer from general knowledge.
- Map capabilities to standard specialty names (camelCase): cardiology, ophthalmology, etc.
- Flag any contradictions between procedure claims and equipment lists.
- Each fact must be a clear, declarative English statement.
- Empty arrays [] mean "no data found" — this is a valid signal, not missing data."""
